# RS2 Raster Service

RS2 is an experimental remote sensing data service.

## Goals

* catalogue remote sensing and spatial data (digital elevation models, satellite imagery, point clouds) in a directory tree or S3 bucket
* list spatial data available within a given polygon
* return a dataset from either a selected file, or automatically select the best available data (highest res, least cloudy, etc.) in a polygon.

## Progress
Just experimenting with Rust.
